# COGS-211-robot-novel-behavior-lab
A simple robot capable of path integration, for my COGS-211 Perception and Action course.

The robot used is a customized two-wheel robot with KIPR KISS controller. Using only proprioceptive feedback, i.e. how much motor has rotated, the robot is able to track its position and orientation in the world, and to move to any designated point with a small degree of error.

Lab report for this project will follow up soon.
